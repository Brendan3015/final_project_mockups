final_project_mockups
=====================

Fork this repository to your own account, clone it, and then add your HTML mockups to the folder. Don't forget to commit and sync often.

I've included a template.html that demonstrates how to link your documents to the Bootstrap assets. You can copy-paste `template.html`, rename it, and use it as a starting point for each of your documents if you wish.

You can also refer to the Bootstrapped solution from Day 2 repository as another resource: https://github.com/kiei925/bootstrapped_essential_html
